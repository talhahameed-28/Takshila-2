                        <strong> Standard Products: </strong> For jewelry pieces that are not personalized or made-toorder (for example, a standard catalog item with no modifications, if such items exist on our platform), Takshila’s general return policy applies. Typically, for standard products, we offer a return or exchange within a certain time frame (e.g., 14 or 30 days from delivery), provided the item is in its original unused and undamaged condition with all original packaging. However, at this stage, most Takshila products are custom-made to order, so the availability of returns on standard items may be limited. We will clarify on the product page or at checkout if an item is eligible for return.</li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> Made-to-Order Items:</strong> As noted in Section 7, custom-made and personalized items are generally non-returnable and non-refundable. Each Takshila piece is often made to order just for you, therefore we cannot offer refunds or returns unless the item is found to be defective or not as ordered . </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> Manufacturing Defects or Errors:</strong> If you receive an item that has a manufacturing defect, or if we made an error (e.g., wrong engraving, wrong material, incorrect size compared to what was ordered), please contact Takshila within 5 days of delivery to report the issue . We may request photographs or other evidence of the defect/problem. In cases of confirmed defects or mistakes on our part, Takshila will make it right by: 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Offering a free repair or remake of the piece. We will work with our artisans to correct any defect and craft the jewelry again at no additional cost to you. </li>
                        <li> If repair or remake is not feasible or fails to resolve the issue, offering a replacement or a full refund at our discretion. For any return of a defective item, we will provide instructions. The customer may be
                        responsible for shipping the item back to us or to an artisan (we may provide a prepaid label in some cases, or we may reimburse reasonable return shipping costs if the defect is confirmed). Once we receive the item, we will proceed with the repair/replacement or refund. </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> Return Shipping Charges:</strong> If a return is due to a confirmed defect or our error, Takshila will typically cover or reimburse the return shipping. However, if a return or exchange is authorized for other reasons (e.g., a one-time courtesy return on a custom item, or a return of a standard product for buyer’s remorse), the customer is responsible for safe shipping of the item back to us and any associated shipping costs. We recommend insuring any return shipment for the value of the jewelry, as we cannot be responsible for loss or damage in transit on return shipments. </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> Condition of Returned Items: </strong> For any item that is eligible for return/exchange, it must be returned in the same condition as delivered. Items that have been worn (beyond trying on), resized or altered by the customer, or otherwise damaged through use cannot be returned except in cases of manufacturing defect. We reserve the right to inspect returned items and deny a refund or exchange if the item shows signs of wear, damage, or alteration not caused by Takshila. </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> Refund Processing: </strong> Approved refunds will be processed to the original form of payment. Please allow reasonable time for the refund to be issued once we receive the returned item (typically 5-7 business days for inspection and processing, plus any additional time your bank/card issuer takes to post the credit). Shipping fees (if any) are generally non-refundable except in cases of our error or defect. If a partial refund was agreed (due to deductions for custom order costs as described above), we will clearly communicate the refunded amount to you. </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Exchanges: </strong> If exchanges are allowed (e.g., swapping a standard item for a different size or style), it will be handled as a return of the original item (subject to the above conditions) and a separate purchase of the new item, unless otherwise specified. </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> No Refund on Digital/Service Fees: </strong> If Takshila at any point offers design consultation services for a fee, or other non-tangible services, such fees may be non-refundable once the service has been rendered. We currently do not charge a separate fee for AI design usage or design consultations for jewelry, but if we do in future, those terms will be specified.</li>
                        <li>
                        <strong> Your Legal Rights: </strong> We aim to be fair and transparent with our return policy. Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit any non-waivable statutory rights you might have. For example, if you are a customer in a jurisdiction with specific consumer protection regulations (such as EU consumers’ rights to cancel certain online purchases within 14 days, excluding custom goods), those laws may apply to you. In the EU, custom-made items are often exempt from the 14-day cancellation right due to their personalized nature , which aligns with our noreturn policy on such goods. We will comply with any applicable consumer laws to the extent they cannot be lawfully limited or waived.</li>
